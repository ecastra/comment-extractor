## JavaScript and TypeScript Comment Extractor: A Comprehensive Guide

This document provides a detailed explanation of a comment extractor for JavaScript and TypeScript, its implementation, and a user guide for its effective use. 

**Introduction**

The comment extractor is a powerful tool designed to efficiently identify and extract comments from JavaScript and TypeScript code. It leverages a state machine, bitmasks, and optimized string search algorithms to ensure accurate comment collection even in complex scenarios.

**Key Features:**

* **Supports Various Comment Types:** The extractor handles single-line comments (`//`), multi-line comments (`/* */`), HTML comments (`<!-- -->`), and JSDoc comments (`/** */`).
* **Handles Nested Comments:**  Accurately recognizes nested multiline comments and correctly identifies their boundaries.
* **Manages Special Constructs:**  Safely skips over comments within strings, template literals, regular expressions, JSX expressions, and other constructs.
* **Recognizes Comments Near Special Characters:** Handles comments adjacent to punctuation characters and symbols, including those in template literals.
* **Efficient Performance:** Utilizes bitmasks and optimized string search algorithms for fast comment extraction, especially in large codebases.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Includes safeguards to handle potential errors during comment parsing and provides informative feedback.
* **Handles Comments in Class Declarations:** Accurately identifies and extracts comments within class declarations, even those interspersed with semicolons.
* **Handles Comments in Class Generators:** Accurately identifies and extracts comments within class generators, ensuring correct parsing of the `*` symbol.
* **User-Configurable Comment Types:** Allows the user to specify which comment types to extract using the `commentTypes` option.

**Options:**

The comment extractor accepts an optional `options` object with the following property:

- `commentTypes`: A string value specifying which comment types to extract. 
    - `"all"`: Support all comment types (default).
    - `"singleline"`: Support only single-line comments.
    - `"multiline"`: Support only multiline comments.
    - `"html"`: Support only HTML comments.
    - `"jsdoc"`: Support only JSDoc comments.

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Comments near special characters and punctuation:**

```javascript
const value = 10 + // This is a comment adjacent to '+'
               20;
const message = "This is a string with a comment /* inside */";
const greeting = `Hello, world! // This is a comment after backtick `; 
const result = value * 2; // This is a comment after '*'
```

**Example 2: Nested comments within comments:**

```javascript
/* This is a multiline comment
  * with a nested single-line comment: // This is a nested comment 
  * and another nested multiline comment: /* Nested multiline comment */
*/
```

**Example 3: Comments within special constructs:**

```javascript
const message = "This is a string with a comment /* inside */";
const regex = /This is a regex with a comment /* inside */ /;
const jsxElement = <div>{/* This is a JSX comment */}</div>; 
```

**Example 4:  Comments at the beginning and end of code:**

```javascript
// This is a comment at the beginning of the code
const value = 10; 
// This is a comment at the end of the code
```

**Example 5:  Comments with escaped characters:**

```javascript
/* This is a comment with an escaped backslash: \\* */
```

**Example 6: HTML and JSDoc Comments:**

```javascript
/** This is a JSDoc comment 
  * with a nested HTML comment: <!-- This is an HTML comment --> 
  */

<!-- This is an HTML comment /** This is a JSDoc comment */ --> 
```

**Example 7: Comments near punctuation:**

```javascript
const value = 10 + // This is a comment adjacent to '+'
               20;
```

**Example 8: Comments before and after template literals:**

```javascript
// This is a comment before the template literal
\`This is a template literal with a comment /* inside */\`; 
// This is a comment after the template literal
```

**Example 9:  Comments in JSX:**

```javascript
const jsxElement = <div>{/* This is a JSX comment */}</div>;
```

**Example 10:  Comments in array with elison:**

```javascript
const myArray = [
  'Hello', 
  'World', // This is a comment
  `This is a template literal with a comment /* inside */` // This is another comment
];
```

**Example 11: Comment within array elison:**

```javascript
const myArray = [
  ,,,/* hello  */,,
];
```

**Example 12: Comments within class declarations:**

```javascript
class MyClass {
  // This is a comment inside the class.
  ;;;/*++*/;;; // This is another comment with semicolons.
  method() {
    // This is a comment inside a method.
  }
}
```

**Example 13: Comments within class generators:**

```javascript
class MyClass {
  // This is a comment inside the class.
  *generatorMethod() {
    // This is a comment inside the generator method.
    yield 1; 
    // This is another comment inside the generator method.
    yield 2;
  }

  // This is another comment inside the class. 
}
```

**Example 14: Comments with different types and sequences:**

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment at the beginning. 
/* This is a multiline comment 
   spanning multiple lines.
   It contains a nested single-line comment: // This is a nested comment 
   and another nested multiline comment: /* Nested multiline comment */
*/

/** This is a JSDoc comment with a nested single-line comment: // This is a nested comment 
  * It spans multiple lines.
  */

class MyClass {
  // This is a comment inside the class. 
  ;;;/*++*/;;; // This is another comment with semicolons.
  method() {
    // This is a comment inside a method.
  }

  *generatorMethod() {
    // This is a comment inside the generator method.
    yield 1; 
    // This is another comment inside the generator method.
    yield 2;
  }

  // This is another comment inside the class.
}

X =
/* arrow */
> y;
// This is a comment after a punctuator.

/* This is a multiline comment 
   spanning multiple lines.
   It contains a nested single-line comment: // This is a nested comment 
   and another nested multiline comment: /* Nested multiline comment */
*/
// This is a single-line comment at the end.
```

**Using the Comment Extractor in a Printer:**

Here's a conceptual example of how you might use the `collectComments` function within a JavaScript or TypeScript printer to include comments in your output:

```javascript
// ... (Assuming you have a code printer function) ...

function printNode(node, commentPlacement = 'after') {
  let output = "";

  // ... existing logic to print the node ...

  // Collect comments associated with the node
  const comments = collectComments(source, node.getStart(), node.getEnd());

  // Add comments based on placement and type
  if (commentPlacement === 'before') {
    comments.forEach((comment) => {
      if (comment.type === 'html') {
        output += `\n<!-- ${source.substring(comment.start, comment.end)} -->`; 
      } else if (comment.type === 'jsdoc') {
        output += `\n/** ${source.substring(comment.start, comment.end)} */`; 
      } else { // Single-line or multiline comments
        output += `\n// ${comment.type === 'multiline' ? '/*' : ''}${source.substring(comment.start, comment.end)}${comment.type === 'multiline' ? '*/' : ''}`;
      }
    });
    output += `\n${node.getText()}`; // Print the node after comments
  } else { // commentPlacement === 'after' (default)
    output += `\n${node.getText()}`; // Print the node first
    comments.forEach((comment) => {
      if (comment.type === 'html') {
        output += `\n<!-- ${source.substring(comment.start, comment.end)} -->`; 
      } else if (comment.type === 'jsdoc') {
        output += `\n/** ${source.substring(comment.start, comment.end)} */`; 
      } else { // Single-line or multiline comments
        output += `\n// ${comment.type === 'multiline' ? '/*' : ''}${source.substring(comment.start, comment.end)}${comment.type === 'multiline' ? '*/' : ''}`;
      }
    });
  }

  return output;
}

// Example usage
const output = printNode(myNode, 'before'); 
console.log(output);
```

**Resulting Output (Example 14):**

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment at the beginning. 
/* This is a multiline comment 
   spanning multiple lines.
   It contains a nested single-line comment: // This is a nested comment 
   and another nested multiline comment: /* Nested multiline comment */
*/

/** This is a JSDoc comment with a nested single-line comment: // This is a nested comment 
  * It spans multiple lines.
  */

class MyClass {
  // This is a comment inside the class. 
  ;;;
  /* ++++ */
  ;;;
  // This is another comment with semicolons.
  method() {
    // This is a comment inside a method.
  }

  *generatorMethod() {
    // This is a comment inside the generator method.
    yield 1; 
    // This is another comment inside the generator method.
    yield 2;
  }

  // This is another comment inside the class.
}

X =
/* arrow */
> y;
// This is a comment after a punctuator.

/* This is a multiline comment 
   spanning multiple lines.
   It contains a nested single-line comment: // This is a nested comment 
   and another nested multiline comment: /* Nested multiline comment */
*/
// This is a single-line comment at the end.
```
